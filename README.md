Problem Statement
	•	The goal is to detect anomalies in industrial equipment behavior using sensor data.
	•	The model should help prevent equipment failure by predicting unusual operational patterns.
	Dataset Understanding
	•	Use the dataset from Kaggle: Industrial Equipment Monitoring Dataset. (Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dnkumars/industrial-equipment-monitoring-dataset)
	•	The dataset contains sensor readings over time for multiple components, which are useful for predictive maintenance.
	Data Loading and Inspection
	•	Load the CSV file using pandas.
	•	Check the structure: number of columns, data types, missing values, and time-series characteristics.
	Data Cleaning
	•	Handle missing or null values through interpolation or removal.
	•	Convert timestamp columns to datetime if applicable.
	•	Drop irrelevant columns if necessary (e.g., ID fields not contributing to analysis).
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Visualize sensor readings over time to observe normal vs abnormal behavior.
	•	Plot rolling averages, heatmaps, and correlation matrices.
	•	Analyze trends, spikes, and noise in the equipment data.
	Feature Engineering
	•	Derive statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, and moving averages.
	•	Create lag-based features to capture temporal patterns.
	•	Use domain knowledge to define thresholds or custom anomaly flags if needed.
	Anomaly Detection Techniques
	•	Use unsupervised models like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoders to detect outliers.
	•	Optionally apply clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) to group normal vs abnormal patterns.
	•	If labeled data is present, apply classification models like Random Forest or Logistic Regression.
	Model Evaluation
	•	Evaluate performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC 
	•	Use confusion matrix to understand false positives and false negatives.
	•	Visualize anomaly scores over time for interpretability.
	Result Interpretation
	•	Identify which sensors contributed most to detected anomalies.
	•	Highlight patterns of degradation or failure.
	•	Suggest proactive maintenance based on sensor trends.
	Deployment Possibilities
	•	Integrate anomaly detection into a dashboard.
	•	Schedule periodic monitoring using batch jobs or streaming solutions (e.g., Kafka + Spark).
	Future Scope
	•	Extend to multivariate time-series forecasting.
	•	Use real-time streaming data with deep learning (e.g., LSTMs).
	•	Incorporate external variables like temperature or usage logs for enhanced accuracy.
